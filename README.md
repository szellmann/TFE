Toy repo to draft out an API for a simple header-only TFE library
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This repo is currently *completely* unfit for any purpose; the only reason it's public is b/c "no secrets", and because that way it's easier to share with others.

The idea is to eventually have an header-only TF Editor library that supports widgets, but also free-hand drawing, and only depends on OpenGL, and that can be used on the Desktop and in VR.
